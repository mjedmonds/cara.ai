But current AI methods lack the *general* in AGI. Using large amounts of data for narrowly focused tasks, these methods learn in a different paradigm than humans. Humans are able to generalize and form concepts from small amounts of data; that is, humans learn from small data to accomplish big tasks.

CARA is dedicated to learning concepts such as functionality, physics, intention, and causality in a fashion that more closely resembles human learning. We devise methods to learn these concepts in ways that make the knowledge generalizable, intuitive, and interpretable.
